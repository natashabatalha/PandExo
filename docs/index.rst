PandExo: An Exoplanet ETC 
==================================

Tools to help the community with planning exoplanet observations.

.. note::
    The online PandExo module has moved to
    `STScI's ExoCTK <https://exoctk.stsci.edu/pandexo/>`_. 

PandExo is both an online tool and a python package for generating instrument simulations of JWST's NIRSpec, NIRCam, NIRISS and NIRCam and HST WFC3. It uses throughput calculations from STScI's Exposure Time Calculator, Pandeia: Pandeia + Exoplanets = PandExo. This documentation contains information on how to download, install and analyze PandExo output.
