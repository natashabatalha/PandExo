Tools to help the community with planning exoplanet observations.

PandExo is both an online tool and a python package for generating instrument simulations of JWST’s NIRSpec, NIRCam, NIRISS and NIRCam and HST WFC3. It uses throughput calculations from STScI’s Exposure Time Calculator, Pandeia: Pandeia + Exoplanets = PandExo. This documentation contains information on how to download, install and analyze PandExo output.

Should I install PandExo or use the online interface? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install if... 

- I will be using PandExo for more than 10 runs 
- I want to submit bash runs 
- I want to use the online GUI but don't want to be subject to any slow downs because of high user frequency 
- I want to be able to use plotting functions to analyze my output 

Install EVEN if... 

- I am scared of Python

Do not install if...

- I will only be using PandExo fewer than 10 times
- I have a student who can install it for me

Requires
