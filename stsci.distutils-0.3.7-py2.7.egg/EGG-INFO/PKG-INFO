Description: Introduction
        ============
        This package contains utilities used to package some of STScI's Python
        projects; specifically those projects that comprise stsci_python_ and
        Astrolib_.
        
        It currently consists mostly of some setup_hook scripts meant for use with
        `distutils2/packaging`_ and/or d2to1_, and a customized easy_install command
        meant for use with distribute_.
        
        This package is not meant for general consumption, though it might be worth
        looking at for examples of how to do certain things with your own packages, but
        YMMV.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        Hook Scripts
        ------------
        Currently the main features of this package are a couple of setup_hook scripts.
        In distutils2, a setup_hook is a script that runs at the beginning of any
        pysetup command, and can modify the package configuration read from setup.cfg.
        There are also pre- and post-command hooks that only run before/after a
        specific setup command (eg. build_ext, install) is run.
        
        stsci.distutils.hooks.use_packages_root
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        If using the ``packages_root`` option under the ``[files]`` section of
        setup.cfg, this hook will add that path to ``sys.path`` so that modules in your
        package can be imported and used in setup.  This can be used even if
        ``packages_root`` is not specified--in this case it adds ``''`` to
        ``sys.path``.
        
        stsci.distutils.hooks.version_setup_hook
        ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        Creates a Python module called version.py which currently contains four
        variables:
        
        * ``__version__`` (the release version)
        * ``__svn_revision__`` (the SVN revision info as returned by the ``svnversion``
          command)
        * ``__svn_full_info__`` (as returned by the ``svn info`` command)
        * ``__setup_datetime__`` (the date and time that setup.py was last run).
        
        These variables can be imported in the package's ``__init__.py`` for degugging
        purposes.  The version.py module will *only* be created in a package that
        imports from the version module in its ``__init__.py``.  It should be noted
        that this is generally preferable to writing these variables directly into
        ``__init__.py``, since this provides more control and is less likely to
        unexpectedly break things in ``__init__.py``.
        
        stsci.distutils.hooks.version_pre_command_hook
        ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        Identical to version_setup_hook, but designed to be used as a pre-command
        hook.
        
        stsci.distutils.hooks.version_post_command_hook
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        The complement to version_pre_command_hook.  This will delete any version.py
        files created during a build in order to prevent them from cluttering an SVN
        working copy (note, however, that version.py is *not* deleted from the build/
        directory, so a copy of it is still preserved).  It will also not be deleted
        if the current directory is not an SVN working copy.  For example, if source
        code extracted from a source tarball it will be preserved.
        
        stsci.distutils.hooks.tag_svn_revision
        ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        A setup_hook to add the SVN revision of the current working copy path to the
        package version string, but only if the version ends in .dev.
        
        For example, ``mypackage-1.0.dev`` becomes ``mypackage-1.0.dev1234``.  This is
        in accordance with the version string format standardized by PEP 386.
        
        This should be used as a replacement for the ``tag_svn_revision`` option to
        the egg_info command.  This hook is more compatible with packaging/distutils2,
        which does not include any VCS support.  This hook is also more flexible in
        that it turns the revision number on/off depending on the presence of ``.dev``
        in the version string, so that it's not automatically added to the version in
        final releases.
        
        This hook does require the ``svnversion`` command to be available in order to
        work.  It does not examine the working copy metadata directly.
        
        stsci.distutils.hooks.numpy_extension_hook
        ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        This is a pre-command hook for the build_ext command.  To use it, add a
        ``[build_ext]`` section to your setup.cfg, and add to it::
        
            pre-hook.numpy-extension-hook = stsci.distutils.hooks.numpy_extension_hook
        
        This hook must be used to build extension modules that use Numpy.   The primary
        side-effect of this hook is to add the correct numpy include directories to
        `include_dirs`.  To use it, add 'numpy' to the 'include-dirs' option of each
        extension module that requires numpy to build.  The value 'numpy' will be
        replaced with the actual path to the numpy includes.
        
        stsci.distutils.hooks.is_display_option
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        This is not actually a hook, but is a useful utility function that can be used
        in writing other hooks.  Basically, it returns ``True`` if setup.py was run
        with a "display option" such as --version or --help.  This can be used to
        prevent your hook from running in such cases.
        
        stsci.distutils.hooks.glob_data_files
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        A pre-command hook for the install_data command.  Allows filename wildcards as
        understood by ``glob.glob()`` to be used in the data_files option.  This hook
        must be used in order to have this functionality since it does not normally
        exist in distutils.
        
        This hook also ensures that data files are installed relative to the package
        path.  data_files shouldn't normally be installed this way, but the
        functionality is required for a few special cases.
        
        
        Commands
        --------
        build_optional_ext
        ''''''''''''''''''
        This serves as an optional replacement for the default built_ext command,
        which compiles C extension modules.  Its purpose is to allow extension modules
        to be *optional*, so that if their build fails the rest of the package is
        still allowed to be built and installed.  This can be used when an extension
        module is not definitely required to use the package.
        
        To use this custom command, add::
        
            commands = stsci.distutils.command.build_optional_ext.build_optional_ext
        
        under the ``[global]`` section of your package's setup.cfg.  Then, to mark
        an individual extension module as optional, under the setup.cfg section for
        that extension add::
        
            optional = True
        
        Optionally, you may also add a custom failure message by adding::
        
            fail_message = The foobar extension module failed to compile.
                           This could be because you lack such and such headers.
                           This package will still work, but such and such features
                           will be disabled.

        Changelog
        ===========
        
        0.3.7 (2013-12-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid using ``Popen.stdout`` directly in the version.py SVN revision
          auto-update script to avoid possible ResourceWarnings on Python >= 3.2.
          See https://github.com/spacetelescope/PyFITS/issues/45
        
        
        0.3.6 (2013-11-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a syntax error in Python 3 that was introduced in 0.3.5.  This
          could occur very early in the setup such that it bailed before even 2to3
          could run on the rest of the package.
        
        
        0.3.5 (2013-11-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed an obscure issue that could occur when trying to install with
          easy_install on Python 2 systems that have lib2to3 installed but have never
          used it.
        
        
        0.3.4 (2013-07-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated the check for ``__loader__`` added in v0.3.3 to only perform
          that check on Python >= 3.3, since the issue doesn't apply to older
          Python versions.
        
        
        0.3.3 (2013-07-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated the import-time SVN revision update mechanism in the ``version.py``
          module generated by the ``version_setup_hook`` to avoid running when not in
          a dev version of the package.  This saves time on importing released
          packages when installed on users' systems.
        
        - Added a workaround to a bug on Python 3.3 that could cause stsci.distutils
          to crash during installation.
        
        
        0.3.2 (2013-03-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug in the version hook that could occur if the svnversion command
          fails.
        
        - Updated the template for the version.py module generated by the version hook
          so that ``from .version import *`` will work for applications.
        
        - Added a ``__vdate__`` variable in version.py which may contain a release
          date string by specifying a ``vdate`` option in the ``[metadata]`` section
          of setup.cfg.
        
        - Added a ``stsci_distutils_version`` variable in version.py containing the
          version of stsci.distutils used to generate the file--useful primarily for
          debugging purposes.
        
        - Version 0.3.1 added a new zest.releaser hooks to ensure that source
          distributes are created as tar.gz files instead of zip files--this was left
          out of the changelog for 0.3.1.
        
        - The tar.gz zest.releaser hook is updated in 0.3.2 to only run on stsci
          packages.
        
        
        0.3.1 (2012-06-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug where console output from svn-related programs was assumed to be
          ascii, leading to possible crashes on non-English systems.
        
        
        0.3 (2012-02-20)
        ----------------
        
        - The ``glob_data_files`` hook became a pre-command hook for the install_data
          command instead of being a setup-hook.  This is to support the additional
          functionality of requiring data_files with relative destination paths to be
          install relative to the package's install path (i.e. site-packages).
        
        - Dropped support for and deprecated the easier_install custom command.
          Although it should still work, it probably won't be used anymore for
          stsci_python packages.
        
        - Added support for the ``build_optional_ext`` command, which replaces/extends
          the default ``build_ext`` command.  See the README for more details.
        
        - Added the ``tag_svn_revision`` setup_hook as a replacement for the
          setuptools-specific tag_svn_revision option to the egg_info command.  This
          new hook is easier to use than the old tag_svn_revision option: It's
          automatically enabled by the presence of ``.dev`` in the version string, and
          disabled otherwise.
        
        - The ``svn_info_pre_hook`` and ``svn_info_post_hook`` have been replaced with
          ``version_pre_command_hook`` and ``version_post_command_hook`` respectively.
          However, a new ``version_setup_hook``, which has the same purpose, has been
          added.  It is generally easier to use and will give more consistent results
          in that it will run every time setup.py is run, regardless of which command
          is used.  ``stsci.distutils`` itself uses this hook--see the `setup.cfg` file
          and `stsci/distutils/__init__.py` for example usage.
        
        - Instead of creating an `svninfo.py` module, the new ``version_`` hooks create
          a file called `version.py`.  In addition to the SVN info that was included
          in `svninfo.py`, it includes a ``__version__`` variable to be used by the
          package's `__init__.py`.  This allows there to be a hard-coded
          ``__version__`` variable included in the source code, rather than using
          pkg_resources to get the version.
        
        - In `version.py`, the variables previously named ``__svn_version__`` and
          ``__full_svn_info__`` are now named ``__svn_revision__`` and
          ``__svn_full_info__``.
        
        - Fixed a bug when using stsci.distutils in the installation of other packages
          in the ``stsci.*`` namespace package.  If stsci.distutils was not already
          installed, and was downloaded automatically by distribute through the
          setup_requires option, then ``stsci.distutils`` would fail to import.  This
          is because the way the namespace package (nspkg) mechanism currently works,
          all packages belonging to the nspkg *must* be on the import path at initial
          import time.
        
          So when installing stsci.tools, for example, if ``stsci.tools`` is imported
          from within the source code at install time, but before ``stsci.distutils``
          is downloaded and added to the path, the ``stsci`` package is already
          imported and can't be extended to include the path of ``stsci.distutils``
          after the fact.  The easiest way of dealing with this, it seems, is to
          delete ``stsci`` from ``sys.modules``, which forces it to be reimported, now
          the its ``__path__`` extended to include ``stsci.distutil``'s path.
        
        - Added zest.releaser hooks for tweaking the development version string
          template, and for uploading new releases to STScI's local package index.
        
        
        0.2.2 (2011-11-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed check for the issue205 bug on actual setuptools installs; before it
          only worked on distribute.  setuptools has the issue205 bug prior to version
          0.6c10.
        
        - Improved the fix for the issue205 bug, especially on setuptools.
          setuptools, prior to 0.6c10, did not back of sys.modules either before
          sandboxing, which causes serious problems.  In fact, it's so bad that it's
          not enough to add a sys.modules backup to the current sandbox: It's in fact
          necessary to monkeypatch setuptools.sandbox.run_setup so that any subsequent
          calls to it also back up sys.modules.
        
        
        0.2.1 (2011-09-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the dependencies so that setuptools is requirement but 'distribute'
          specifically.  Previously installation could fail if users had plain
          setuptools installed and not distribute
        
        0.2 (2011-08-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial public release
